ALICE 
============================
ALICE is an autonomous link-based TSCH cell scheduling solution. ALICE uses Contiki Orchestra code as its skeleton code.
ALICE uses three slotframes (EB, broadcast/default and unicast) as Orchestra does.
The main difference is unicast slotframe schedule which implements time-varying scheduling and link-based scheduling.

ALICE source code location: ./apps/alice/ and ./core/net/mac/tsch/
ALICE example code location: ./examples/ipv6/rpl-udp-alice-log/




The Contiki Operating System
============================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/contiki-os/contiki.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/contiki-os/contiki/branches)

Contiki is an open source operating system that runs on tiny low-power
microcontrollers and makes it possible to develop applications that
make efficient use of the hardware while providing standardized
low-power wireless communication for a range of hardware platforms.

Contiki is used in numerous commercial and non-commercial systems,
such as city sound monitoring, street lights, networked electrical
power meters, industrial monitoring, radiation monitoring,
construction site monitoring, alarm systems, remote house monitoring,
and so on.
